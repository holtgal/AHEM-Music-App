Holt Galbraith, Erich Bernhardt, Miles Eddy, Anna Grant

In project 1 we will create a web application based around using music api's to search artist and there future tour dates . The initial 2 API's we would like to implement  are  wikipedia search which will populate information regarding the artist and there bio. As a second API we would like to use YouTube to populate popular videos of the respective artist searched.
