In project 1 we created a web application based around using music api's to search artists and suggest comparable artists. The initial 2 API's we implemented are a TasteDive search, which will populate information regarding the artist, their bio, and comparable artists. As a second API we would like to use YouTube to populate popular videos of the respective artist searched.
